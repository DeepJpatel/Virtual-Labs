Firewall basics in a (Linux) virtual lab environment. (June 13, 2025)

Part 1: Configure an iptables Firewall 
        1. Created a fictional network to test the iptables firewall
        2. rules: sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 10.0.0.1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT , sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 10.0.0.0/24 -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP

Part 2: Test an iptables Firewall
        1. Used a tool called Mininet to emulate the admin and user desktop. 
        2. Used the Nmap tool to find the open ports in both the admin and user desktops.
        3. Flushed unnecessary DROP rules and updated the IPTables rules. 

Part 3: Challenge Exercise 
       Identified two open TCP ports & wrote 3 IP Tables rules, one for the lower TCP port and the higher TCP port. 

Lab exercise completed.
